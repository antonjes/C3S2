    "Sea level variation is an important indicator of climate change, as it integrates changes of almost all the components in the climate system [[1]](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/10/281/2018/). It specially impacts coastal societies and environments [[2]](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2023.1150488). However, sea level change at the global scale is not uniform varying on a regional to local scale from global mean rates (e.g.,[[3]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2013.12.004), [[4]](https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-5-243-2014)). For instance, sea level trends in the Mediterranean differ from global mean sea level trends, mainly because of its semi-enclosed conditions ([[5]](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-13-00139.1)). In addition,  within the Mediterranean, sea level trends can differ from the basin mean [[6]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-016-3001-2) due to non-linear local oceanographic processes [[7]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2009.04.002). The Mediterranean Sea has been clasified as one of the most susceptible climate change zones worldwide [[8]](https://doi.org/10.1029/2006GL025734). Thus, sea level rise  may significantly impact coastal populations and activities due, among others, to the local vertical land motion processes in the basin that can cause land subsidence amplifying the effects of rising sea levels in the region [[9]](https://doi.org/10.1029/2011JC007469),[[10]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jog.2019.05.007). This makes necessary the understanding of sea level change at the scale of the Mediterranean Sea [[2]](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2023.1150488). In this context,  this notebook aims to evaluate the long-term sea level variability in the Mediterranean at both regional and sub-basin scales over the period 1993-2023. This assessment is based on the analysis conducted in [[2]](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2023.1150488) from satellite altimetry data."

    "* At sub-basin scale, the highest positive rates are observed over the Aegean Sea (3.1 ± 1.0 mm/yr) and Levantine Basin (2.6 ± 0.9 mm/yr), especially in regions where recurring gyres and eddies in the ocean circulation are present\n",

These zones are: the Balearic Islands area in the Western Mediterranean, in a very large portion of the Ionian Peninsula, and also over Southern Crete."

    " This notebook provides an assessment of long-term sea level trends in the Mediterranean Sea from satellite-derived sea level observations at both regional and sub-basin scales. In a first step, these observations are corrected for glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) using the geoid height estimates (dGeoid) from the ICE-6G_C (VM5a) model [[12]](https://doi.org/10.1002/2014JB011176) as a correction for the local vertical land movements. In a second step, a TOPEX-A instrumental drift correction, derived from altimetry and tide gauge global comparisons, is added to the sea level dataset to account for altimeter instrumental drift that influences the accuracy and uncertainty of the records between 1993-1998 (e.g., [[13]](https://doi.org/10.1038/nclimate2635)). Although this correction is computed for the global mean sea level, it can also be used at regional or local scales as a best available estimate. This is still preferable to not correcting at all, given that the regional variation of the instrumental drift is currently unknown [[2]](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2023.1150488). In addition, the mean seasonal cycle is removed from the time series. Finally, a non-parametric Mann–Kendall test ([[14]](https://doi.org/10.2307/1907187),[[15]]()) modified for auto-correlated data [[16]](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-1694(97)00125-X) is used to assess statistical significance of the trend at the 95% confidence interval. Sea level trends are computed over the period 1993-2023 at basin scale and for the following sub-regions: Western Mediterranean basin, Adriatic Sea, Aegean Sea, Ionian Sea, Levantine Basin, Southern Central Mediterranean, Southern Crete and Tyrrhenian Sea.
